This application was initially designed and implemented as a detour for most of time-tracking systems.

As most of the time-tracking systems are looking on the state of machine (it shouldn`t go to sleep state, etc.), the purpose of this project is to make a view of all-the time presence in front of the working machine.

If you`d like to use it for your purposes, please, be aware that the process is called "HelloToTimeTracker", so if you just launch it as it is, some trackers will show you the "HelloToTimeTracker" as a main process. If you want to rename it somehow - copy the code, paste it in the new created project and name it as you wish.

Note, that this project is implemented with .NET 5 version.

Good luck!
